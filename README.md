## Goals

I wanted to create a silly project. I also wanted to learn a few technologies(TypeScript, Jest, Cypress) and do a lot of interactivity in a side project.

## FAQ

**But why?**

> Why not?

**Why didn't you use React?**

> I could have used React or a different library or framework, but this project is built without a framework because I felt like doing a project where I could focus on other things. I also started this project before Hooks were released, and I didn't feel like doing a React project until they were released. Right now I don't plan on using something like React for this project.
